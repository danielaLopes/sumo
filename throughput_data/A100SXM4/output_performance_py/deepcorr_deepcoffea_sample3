Simulating Deep Corr.
Model occupies 861.860 MB GPU memory
Disregard the total time shown in tqdm. The purpose of this loop is to get the average only.
Each training iteration (after warm up) takes on average 0.084627 seconds including moving data between devices, excluding recording the loss or evaluating training accuracy.
Testing 300 flow pairs takes 0:00:20.063732 including moving data between devices, inference and moving results between devices, excluding data preprocessing and result recording.
So, for 1000 flow pairs, it will take 0:03:42.930352
So, a single flow pair takes 0.000223 seconds
Simulating Deep Coffea, flow length: 500, 800.
Model anchor occupies 4.430 MB GPU memory
Model pandn occupies 4.561 MB GPU memory
Each training iteration (batch size 256, after warm up) takes on average 0.018845 seconds including moving data between devices, excluding recording the loss or evaluating training accuracy.
Inference loop - each iteration takes on average 0.003170 seconds.
Testing 1000 flow pairs takes 0:00:00.037501 including moving data between devices, inference, moving results between devices, and compute cosine similarity, excluding data preprocessing and result recording.
