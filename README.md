# SUMo

This repository presents the code for the artefact evaluation for The Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2024.

To run the experiements we need the extracted features from the dataset. Download them from here:
https://zenodo.org/record/8369700/files/extracted_features.tar.gz

Decompress with:
```gzip -d extracted_features.tar.gz && tar -xf extracted_features.tar```

The datasets are also available from:
 * [OSTrain.tar.gz](https://zenodo.org/record/8362616/files/OSTrain.tar.gz)
 * [OSValidate.tar.gz](https://zenodo.org/record/8360991/files/OSValidate.tar.gz)
 * [OSTest.tar.gz](https://zenodo.org/record/8359342/files/OSTest.tar.gz)

## Experiments in the artefact evalution

We have a selection of experiments that can be easily executed via bash scripts.
First make sure you follow the instructions in [setup.sh](./setup.sh), which will install all the dependencies.

### Experience 1



### Experience 2



### Experience 3

### Experience 4



### Experience 5

To collect the latency/throughput metrics of SUMo follow the instructions in (experience5.sh)[./experiment5.sh]. It should output a plot in `experiment5/plot_subsetsum2d.pdf` with the latency/throughput curve of our solution. The script also prints the point with maximum throughput.
